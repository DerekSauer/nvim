# My Neovim Configuration

I do not recommend using my configuration as your own since I am constantly messing with it and functionality may change or fail without warning. Feel free to crib ideas from this configuration.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository into:
    * Windows: `~\AppData\Local\nvim\`.
    * Linux: `~/.config/nvim/`.
2. Run Neovim. Lazy will automatically install itself and any needed plugins.
